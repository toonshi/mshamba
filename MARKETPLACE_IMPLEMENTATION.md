# 🏪 Marketplace Implementation Complete!

## What We Built

A complete **on-platform marketplace** where farmers can buy inputs/services with ckUSDC, and every transaction is automatically verified on Hedera HCS.

## 🎯 Your Vision → Reality

### What You Wanted:

```

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy & Test

### Step 1: Deploy Backend Canisters

```bash
# Start local network (if not running)
dfx start --background

# Deploy new canisters
dfx deploy marketplace
dfx deploy hedera_integration

# Get canister IDs
dfx canister id marketplace
dfx canister id hedera_integration
```

### Step 2: Start Hedera Service

```bash
cd hedera-service
npm start  # Should be running on port 3001
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend

```bash
cd src/mshamba_frontend
npm run dev  # Opens on http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 4: Test the Flow

**A. Register as Supplier:**
1. Go to `/register`
2. Choose role: "Supplier"
3. Fill name: "Kenya Seed Company"
4. Click "Get Current Location" (or enter manually)
5. Add region: "Nakuru"
6. Click "Complete Registration"

**B. Create a Listing:**
1. Go to `/marketplace/create-listing`
2. Category: Seeds
3. Title: "Hybrid Maize Seeds H614"
4. Description: "Certified drought-resistant maize seeds"
5. Price: 15 (ckUSDC)
6. Unit: kg
7. Quantity: 100
8. Location: Use current location
9. Click "Create Listing"

**C. Buy as Farmer:**

## 🔧 Current Status

### ✅ Fully Functional:
- User registration with roles
- Create marketplace listings
- Browse listings with filters
- Location-based distance calculation
- Transaction creation
- Hedera auto-logging
- Verification badges

### ⏳ TODO for Production:

**1. ckUSDC Payment Integration** (Currently mocked)
```motoko
// In marketplace.mo, add actual payment:
import CkUSDC "./ckusdc_payment";

// In createPurchase function:
let paymentResult = await CkUSDC.transferCkUSDC(
  buyerId,
  sellerId,
  totalAmount,
  ?Text.encodeUtf8(transactionId),
  false // useTestnet = false for mainnet
);
```

**2. HTTP Outcalls for Backend → Hedera**
Currently frontend calls Hedera service. For production, backend should call directly:
```motoko
// Enable HTTP outcalls in hedera_integration.mo
// Requires cycles management
```

**3. Image Uploads**
- Integrate with IPFS or ICP storage
- Add image upload to CreateListing

**4. Location Mapping** (Next iteration)
- Integrate Mapbox/Google Maps
- Show suppliers on map
- Route optimization

**5. Rating & Reviews**
- Add review system
- Update seller ratings
- Display reviews on listings

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Seed Purchase
```
1. Supplier creates "Maize Seeds" listing at 15 ckUSDC/kg
2. Farmer buys 10 kg
3. Payment: 150 ckUSDC transferred
4. Hedera logs: INPUT_PURCHASED event

2. Farmer books 1 trip
3. Payment: 50 ckUSDC transferred
4. Hedera logs: SERVICE_PURCHASED event

```

### Scenario 3: Nearby Suppliers
```
1. Farmer in Nakuru opens marketplace
2. GPS captures location: (-0.3031, 36.0800)
3. System calculates distances to all suppliers
4. Shows "Kenya Seed Co - 2.3 km away"

6. Only nearby seed suppliers shown
```

## 🌍 Location Features

### Distance Calculation:
Uses Haversine formula:
```javascript
distance = 2 * R * arcsin(sqrt(
  sin²((lat2-lat1)/2) + 
  cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin²((lon2-lon1)/2)
))
```

Where R = 6371 km (Earth's radius)

### Privacy:
- Only **region** displayed publicly
- Exact coordinates stored privately
- Distance shown to buyers
- GPS capture optional
