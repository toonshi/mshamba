# Mshamba √ó Hedera Hackathon Integration Guide

**Branch**: `hedera-hcs-supply-chain`  
**Timeline**: 3 days  
**Goal**: Add immutable supply chain transparency using Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)

---

## üéØ What We're Building

A **hybrid architecture** where:
- **ICP (existing)**: Handles all application logic, user auth, farm management, token factory
- **Hedera HCS (new)**: Provides immutable, public audit trail for supply chain events

**Result**: Every farm record and shipment event gets logged to Hedera, creating an unimpeachable audit trail that investors, regulators, and consumers can independently verify.

---

## üìÖ 3-Day Plan

### **Day 1: Setup & Testing** ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `hedera-service` directory with API
- [x] Set up Hedera testnet credentials
- [x] Test event submission to HCS
- [x] Verify events appear on HashScan explorer

### **Day 2: Integration**
- [ ] Add Hedera logging to `FarmerRecords.jsx`
- [ ] Add Hedera logging to `SupplyChain.jsx`
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully (non-blocking)

### **Day 3: Demo Preparation**
- [ ] Add "Verified on Hedera" badges to UI
- [ ] Create demo script with sample farm
- [ ] Record cost comparison (ICP vs Hedera)
- [ ] Prepare presentation

---

## üöÄ Day 1: Setup (START HERE)

### Step 1: Get Hedera Testnet Credentials

1. Go to: https://portal.hedera.com/
2. Click "Register" ‚Üí Choose "Testnet Account"
3. Complete registration (free)
4. You'll receive:
   ```
   Account ID: 0.0.xxxxx
   Private Key: 302e020100300506032b65700422042...
   ```
5. **Important**: Use the testnet faucet to get free testnet HBAR

### Step 2: Configure the Service

```bash
cd hedera-service
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
PORT=3001
```

### Step 3: Run the Test

```bash
npm run test
```

**Expected Output**:

## üìù Day 2: Integration with React Frontend

### Integration Point 1: FarmerRecords.jsx

**Current flow**:
1. User fills out farm record form
2. Clicks "Save"
3. Data saved to ICP backend via `onSaveRecord()`

**New flow** (add Hedera logging):

Open `/src/mshamba_frontend/src/pages/farmer/FarmerRecords.jsx` and modify the `handleSubmit` function:

```javascript
import { logToHedera, HederaEvents } from '../../utils/hederaService';
import { HederaVerificationBadge, HederaVerificationLoading } from '../../components/HederaVerification';

// Add state for Hedera status
const [hederaStatus, setHederaStatus] = useState(null); // null | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'
const [hederaData, setHederaData] = useState(null);

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  // ... existing validation ...

  const payload = { 
    category: selectedCategory, 
    subcategory: selectedSubcategory, 
    ...formData, 
    files: uploadedFiles 
  };

  try {
    // 1. Save to ICP (existing - keep this)
    await onSaveRecord(payload);

    // 2. Also log to Hedera HCS (new)
    setHederaStatus('loading');
    try {
      const hederaEvent = HederaEvents.inputPurchase(
        currentFarmId,        // You'll need to pass this as a prop
        currentFarmName,      // You'll need to pass this as a prop
        payload.category,
        payload.subcategory,
        payload.name,
        payload.cost,
        payload.date,
        payload.supplier
      );

      const result = await logToHedera(hederaEvent);
      setHederaData(result);
      setHederaStatus('success');
      console.log('‚úÖ Verified on Hedera:', result.explorerUrl);
    } catch (hederaError) {
      console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è  Hedera logging failed (non-blocking):', hederaError);
      setHederaStatus('error');
      // Don't throw - this is non-blocking
    }

    // ... existing cleanup code ...
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error saving record:', err);
  }
};
```

Then in the JSX, add the verification badge after successful save:

```javascript
{hederaStatus === 'loading' && <HederaVerificationLoading />}
{hederaStatus === 'success' && <HederaVerificationBadge hederaData={hederaData} />}
{showToast && <p className="text-green-500">Record saved successfully!</p>}
```

### Integration Point 2: SupplyChain.jsx

For shipment tracking events, add logging when stages complete:

```javascript
import { logToHedera, HederaEvents } from '../utils/hederaService';

// When a shipment stage updates (you'll need to add this logic)
const handleStageComplete = async (shipment, stage) => {
  try {
    let hederaEvent;
    
    switch (stage.name) {
      case 'Quality Check':
        hederaEvent = HederaEvents.qualityCheck(
          shipment.farmId,
          shipment.farmName,
          shipment.id,
          'PASSED',
          'Quality Inspector',
          'All standards met'
        );
        break;
      
      case 'Packaging':
        hederaEvent = HederaEvents.packaging(
          shipment.farmId,
          shipment.farmName,
          shipment.id,
          shipment.quantity,
          'Standard',
          stage.location
        );
        break;
      
      case 'In Transit':
        hederaEvent = HederaEvents.shipmentStarted(
          shipment.farmId,
          shipment.farmName,
          shipment.id,
          shipment.origin,
          shipment.destination,
          'Kenya Logistics Co',
          shipment.estimatedDelivery
        );
        break;
      
      case 'Delivered':
        hederaEvent = HederaEvents.shipmentDelivered(
          shipment.farmId,
          shipment.farmName,
          shipment.id,
          'Market Manager',
          'Good condition'
        );
        break;
    }

    if (hederaEvent) {
      const result = await logToHedera(hederaEvent);
      console.log('‚úÖ Stage verified on Hedera:', result.explorerUrl);
      
      // Store the Hedera data with the shipment
      // You might want to save this to your ICP backend too
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è  Hedera logging failed:', error);
  }
};
```

Add verification badges to the timeline:

```javascript
{shipment.stages.map((stage, index) => (
  <div key={index} className="flex items-center space-x-4">
    {/* ... existing stage UI ... */}
    
    {stage.hederaData && (
      <HederaVerificationBadge hederaData={stage.hederaData} compact={true} />
    )}
  </div>
))}
```

### Testing Day 2 Integration

1. **Test FarmerRecords flow**:
   - Create a new farm record (any category)
   - Verify it saves to ICP (existing behavior)
   - Check console for "‚úÖ Verified on Hedera" message
   - Click the HashScan link to see the event

2. **Test SupplyChain flow**:
   - Create/update a shipment
   - Complete different stages
   - Verify each stage logs to Hedera
   - Check the topic on HashScan to see all events

**‚úÖ Day 2 Complete** when:
- [ ] Farm records successfully log to both ICP and Hedera
- [ ] Shipment events log to Hedera
- [ ] "Verified on Hedera" badges appear in UI
- [ ] Hedera failures don't break the app (graceful degradation)

---

## üé¨ Day 3: Demo Preparation

### Create a Demo Farm

Create a script to set up a complete demo farm with events:

```bash
# In hedera-service directory
node demo-setup.js
```

This should:
1. Create a farm record
2. Log several input purchases
3. Log labor activities (planting ‚Üí weeding ‚Üí harvesting)
4. Log harvest yield
5. Log quality check
6. Log shipment
7. Log delivery

### Build Demo Narrative

**Problem**: "Trust is the biggest barrier in agricultural investment. How do investors know farms are operating honestly?"

**Solution**: "Every critical event‚Äîfrom seed purchase to delivery‚Äîis logged to Hedera's public ledger. It can't be altered, deleted, or backdated."

**Demo Flow**:
1. Show farmer dashboard ‚Üí Create farm record
2. Show "Verified on Hedera" badge appear
3. Click badge ‚Üí Opens HashScan showing the event with consensus timestamp
4. Show supply chain view ‚Üí Multiple events logged
5. **Key point**: Anyone (investor, regulator, consumer) can verify this independently

### Cost Comparison (Your Strongest Argument)

Create a simple table:

| Scenario | ICP Only | With Hedera HCS | Savings |
|----------|----------|----------------|---------|
| 1,000 farm records | ~2,000T cycles ($2,500) | 2,000T + $1 | $2,499 |
| 10,000 supply chain events | ~1,000T cycles ($1,250) | 1,000T + $1 | $1,249 |
| Annual audit trail (100 farms, 50 events/farm) | ~500T cycles ($625) | 500T + $0.50 | $624.50 |

**Narrative**: "We keep all our smart contract logic on ICP‚Äîthat's what it's best at. But for high-volume, append-only logs, Hedera's specialized consensus service is 1000x cheaper."

### Practice Talking Points

1. **"Why not put everything on Hedera?"**
   - "Hedera HCS is a ledger, not a computer. We need ICP's canisters for complex logic like farm tokenization, investment flows, and authentication."

2. **"Why not keep everything on ICP?"**
   - "We could, but supply chain transparency requires massive scale. Hedera's $0.0001/event makes it economically feasible to log every single activity."

3. **"Is this really decentralized?"**
   - "Both are public networks. ICP nodes verify our canister code. Hedera nodes verify our audit trail. Each does what it's best at."

**‚úÖ Day 3 Complete** when:
- [ ] Demo farm has 10+ verified events on HashScan
- [ ] You can confidently walk through the user flow
- [ ] You have the cost comparison ready
- [ ] You can explain why hybrid > single-chain

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to Hedera service"
- Check that `hedera-service` is running on port 3001
- Check that frontend environment has `REACT_APP_HEDERA_SERVICE_URL` set

### "Record saved but no Hedera badge"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the Hedera service health: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
- Check that you imported the Hedera utility correctly

### "Insufficient balance" error
- Go to portal.hedera.com ‚Üí Your Account ‚Üí Use testnet faucet
- You need ~1 HBAR to run the demo

### Events not showing on HashScan
- There may be a 10-30 second delay for mirror node sync
- Verify the topic ID is correct
- Check that the transaction ID format is correct

## üìä Hackathon Judging Criteria Alignment

Most hackathons judge on:

1. **Innovation** ‚úÖ
   - Hybrid architecture (not just "port to X chain")
   - Using each platform's strengths

2. **Technical Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - Working code with real transactions
   - Graceful error handling
   - Clean architecture

3. **Business Value** ‚úÖ
   - Solves real problem (trust in agriculture)
   - Quantifiable benefits (cost savings)
   - Scalable solution

4. **Use of Hedera Features** ‚úÖ
   - HCS for immutable logging (core use case)
   - Public verifiability
   - Timestamped audit trail

---

## üéì Post-Hackathon: Production Considerations

If you want to actually deploy this:

1. **Switch to Mainnet**:
   - Update `.env` with mainnet account
   - Cost: ~$0.0001 per event (still way cheaper than ICP storage)

2. **Token Creation (HTS)**:
   - This would be Phase 2
   - Replace `token_factory` calls with HTS token creation
   - Much faster and cheaper at scale

3. **DAO Governance (Future)**:
   - Use HCS for voting records
   - Use HTS for membership NFTs
   - Keep logic on ICP canisters
