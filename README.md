## üéØ Vision

**Mshamba** is the **NASDAQ for Kenyan farms** ‚Äî a decentralized platform that enables farmers to raise capital by tokenizing farm equity, allowing anyone to invest in real agricultural businesses without traditional loans or banks.

### The Problem We Solve

**For Farmers:**
- üè¶ Bank loans have predatory 15-25% interest rates
- üìÑ Heavy collateral requirements risk losing land
- ‚è∞ Slow approval processes miss market opportunities
- üí∏ Debt obligations regardless of harvest success

**For Investors:**
- üö´ No access to agricultural investment opportunities
- üìä Lack of transparency in farm operations
- üîí Illiquid investments with no exit strategy
- üåç Limited to local opportunities only

### Our Solution

**Mshamba enables farmers to:**
- ‚úÖ Raise capital by selling tokenized equity (not taking loans)
- ‚úÖ Keep majority ownership (75%+) and operational control
- ‚úÖ Access global investor pool via M-Pesa and crypto
- ‚úÖ Get funds released via milestone verification (transparency)
- ‚úÖ Share profits through dividend distributions
- ‚úÖ Scale with follow-on funding rounds

**Investors get:**
- ‚úÖ Direct ownership in real agricultural businesses
- ‚úÖ Fractional investments starting from 1,000 KES (~$10)
- ‚úÖ Tradable tokens on secondary markets (liquidity)
- ‚úÖ Dividend income from farm profits
- ‚úÖ Transparent milestone tracking and reporting
- ‚úÖ Portfolio diversification across multiple farms

## üí° How It Works

### Example: Joseph's Potato Farm Expansion

**Situation:**
- Joseph owns 100 acres in Nakuru
- Currently farming 60 acres (supplies St. Mary's School)
- Gets new contract opportunity with St. John's School
- Needs 2,000,000 KES to expand to remaining 40 acres
- Can't get bank loan (15% interest, heavy collateral)

**Mshamba Solution:**

1. **Farm Valuation**
   - Python API analyzes farm data + national agricultural benchmarks
   - Farm valued at 25,000,000 KES (post-expansion)
   - Recommendation: Raise 2M by selling 8% equity

2. **Token Creation**
   - Total: 1,000,000 tokens created
   - Joseph keeps: 870,000 tokens (87% ownership, vesting)
   - Mshamba gets: 50,000 tokens (5% for platform services)
   - IFO sale: 80,000 tokens @ 25 KES each = 2,000,000 KES

3. **Investment (IFO - Initial Farm Offering)**
   - 30-day fundraising period
   - Investors pay via M-Pesa (KES) or crypto (USDC)
   - ~200 investors contribute (avg. 10,000 KES each)
   - Fully funded! üéâ

4. **Milestone-Based Fund Release**
   - Funds held in escrow, released in stages:
     - Milestone 1: Equipment purchase (800K) - Month 1
     - Milestone 2: Land preparation (600K) - Month 2  
     - Milestone 3: Planting complete (400K) - Month 3
     - Milestone 4: First delivery (200K) - Month 5
   - Evidence required: Photos, receipts, GPS coordinates
   - Platform verifies before releasing funds

5. **Harvest & Returns**
   - Year 1 profit: 1,700,000 KES
   - Joseph gets: 87% = 1,479,000 KES (no loan interest!)
   - Investors get: 8% = 136,000 KES (~6.8% ROI)
   - Mshamba gets: 5% = 85,000 KES
   - Token value increases (farm proven successful)

6. **Secondary Trading**
   - Post-milestone trading windows
   - P2P marketplace for liquidity
   - Investors can exit or hold for more dividends
   - Token price reflects farm performance

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Setup & Deploy (Local)

```bash
# Start local replica
df_x start --clean --background

# Deploy all canisters
df_x deploy

# Top up token factory with cycles
df_x canister deposit-cycles 10000000000000 token_factory
```

### Create Your First Farm with Token

#### Interactive Script (Recommended)
```bash
./scripts/create-farm-with-token.sh
```
Follow the prompts to create a farm and launch its token!

#### Manual Commands

**1. Create Farmer Profile**
```bash
df_x canister call mshamba_backend createProfile (
  "John Farmer",
  "Organic farming expert", 
  vec { variant { Farmer } },
  vec { "Organic Certification" }
)
```

**2. Create Farm**
```bash
df_x canister call mshamba_backend createFarm (
  "Green Acres Farm",
  "Organic vegetables",
  "Kiambu, Kenya",
  1000000,
  "10 acres",
  "Vegetables",
  12,
  "5000kg tomatoes",
  "25%",
  "John Kamau",
  "15 years",
  "+254712345678",
  "john@greenacres.ke",
  blob "\00\01\02",
  "image/jpeg",
  "Green Acres Farm Token",
  "GAFT",
  1000000000,
  8,
  10000,
  null
)
```

**3. Launch Token**
```bash
# Replace FARM_ID with the farmId from step 2
df_x canister call mshamba_backend launchFarmToken ('("farm-XXXXXXXXXXXXX")')
```

**4. Open for Investment**
```bash
df_x canister call mshamba_backend toggleFarmInvestmentStatus ('("farm-XXXXXXXXXXXXX", true)')
```

### Common Queries

*   **List All Farms:** `df_x canister call mshamba_backend listFarms`
*   **View My Farms:** `df_x canister call mshamba_backend myFarms`
*   **Check Token Details:** `df_x canister call LEDGER_ID icrc1_name`
*   **Check Token Balance:** `df_x canister call LEDGER_ID icrc1_balance_of '(record { owner = principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL"; subaccount = null })'`

### Token Factory Management

*   **Check Status:** `./scripts/manage-token-factory.sh status`
*   **Top Up Cycles:** `./scripts/manage-token-factory.sh topup`
*   **Estimate Remaining Tokens:** `./scripts/manage-token-factory.sh estimate`

### Token Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **token_name** | Full name of the token | "Green Acres Farm Token" |
| **token_symbol** | Trading symbol (3-5 chars) | "GAFT" |
| **token_supply** | Total supply in smallest unit | 1000000000 (10M with 8 decimals) |
| **token_decimals** | Decimal places (usually 8) | 8 |
| **token_transfer_fee** | Fee per transfer | 10000 (0.0001 tokens if decimals=8) |
| **token_logo** | Logo URL or null | "https://example.com/logo.png" |

### Costs

*   **Token Creation:** ~2T cycles per farm token (~$2.50 USD)
*   **Platform covers cost** (cycles deducted from token_factory)
*   **Recommended reserve:** Keep 20T+ cycles in token_factory

### Troubleshooting

*   **"Token must be launched before opening investment"**: Call `launchFarmToken(farmId)` first.
*   **"Out of cycles"**: Top up the token_factory: `df_x canister deposit-cycles 10000000000000 token_factory`
*   **"Only farmers can create farms"**: Create a farmer profile first with `createProfile`.
*   **Token creation taking a long time**: This is normal. Deployment takes 5-15 seconds.

## Mainnet Deployment

*   **Code Review & Testing:** Ensure all tests pass, no console errors, and error handling is verified.
*   **Security Review:** No hardcoded secrets, proper access control, and clean imports.
*   **Configuration:** Update canister IDs in `dfx.json`, set environment variables, and configure frontend for mainnet.
*   **Deployment:** 
    1.  Set network to mainnet: `export DFX_NETWORK=ic`
    2.  Create and use a mainnet deployer identity.
    3.  Top up canisters with cycles (token_factory: 50T+, mshamba_backend: 10T+, mshamba_frontend: 5T+).
    4.  Deploy canisters: `df_x deploy mshamba_backend --network ic`, `df_x deploy token_factory --network ic`, `df_x deploy mshamba_frontend --network ic`.
    5.  Top up the token factory: `df_x canister deposit-cycles 50000000000000 token_factory --network ic`.
    6.  Verify deployments and update configuration files.
    7.  Test core functionality on mainnet.
    8.  Set controllers for security.
*   **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Monitor cycle balances, perform regular top-ups, and track failed transactions.
*   **Emergency Procedures:** Have a plan for running out of cycles, backend failures, and frontend failures.
*   **Cost Projections:** ~50-55T cycles/month for 20 new farms (~$65-70 USD/month).
*   **Scaling:** Plan for increased cycle usage as more farms are onboarded.
*   **Rollback Plan:** Have a process for rolling back to a previous version if a deployment fails.

*   **Enhanced Farm System:** Added 6 new token fields to the Farm type.
*   **Developer Tools:** Added scripts for managing the token factory and creating farms.
*   **Legacy System Cleanup:** Removed the shared `farm1_ledger` and related code.
